## Overview

Qwipo bridges the gap for traditional vendors, manufacturers, and suppliers by providing digital tools, logistics, and financing for B2B retail.  
Our hackathon project is an AI-powered personalized recommendation system to revolutionize retailer experience and optimize distributor business outcomes.

---

## Problem Statement

Retailers on Qwipoâ€™s marketplace face:
- Repetitive buying behaviour and missed relevant products
- Suboptimal business outcomes for both retailers and distributors

**Goal:**  
Deliver a recommendation engine that boosts cross-selling, increases basket value, improves inventory turnover, and helps retailers discover new, profitable products.

---

## Solution Architecture

### Hybrid Recommendation Engine

- **Collaborative Filtering:**  
  Learns from retailer purchase history (what similar stores bought).
- **Content-Based Filtering:**  
  Suggests products similar to those previously bought, using product attributes.
- **Deep Learning Sequence Modeling:**  
  Predicts next likely purchases using retailer buying patterns.

### Business Optimization Layer

- Filters recommendations by stock quantity, profit margin, and sales velocity to ensure actionable, profitable results.

## Tech Stack

- **Web & Microservices:** Node.js (Fastify), Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **ML Frameworks:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **APIs:** REST/GraphQL, WebSocket
- **Advanced Integration:** OpenAI/Gemini for NLP and vector embeddings

---

## Features

- Retailer profiling (store type, location, credit tier)
- Seasonal and temporal feature engineering
- Product attributes: margin, expiry, supplier region
- Real-time recommendations (WebSocket integration)
- Business-aware ranking

---

## Team Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition:**  
   - Use public datasets (Kaggle/UCI) or generate synthetic B2B data
   - Engineer rich features: retailer type, order frequency, product margins

2. **Model Development:**  
   - Encode IDs, design two-tower DNN (collaborative + content-based)
   - Integrate product metadata and business metrics
   - Train on temporally split data

3. **Business Ranking:**  
   - Merge model relevance with business metrics
   - Apply weighted scoring: prioritize profitable, high-stock, fast-moving products

4. **Deployment:**  
   - Serve via FastAPI microservices
   - Orchestrate business logic and real-time API responses with Node.js
   - Containerize for hackathon demo (Docker)
